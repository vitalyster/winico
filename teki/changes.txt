    o Broke out the utility code (Debug, Undo, Progress, etc) into
      packages.
    o Added a progress bar for the Web downloading
    o Tons of little changes to UI

    o Made the package wizard not come up if there's only one package
      to be installed.
    o Made architecture list that comes up in the wizard match what's
      available.  If no object files need to be installed, the wizard
      is skipped.
    o Made teki file bundling simpler.  Now, a teki bundle file just calls
      TekiReadFile for all it's bundled .tek files (each in its own
      subdirectory), and then fixes up the srcDir attribute of the 
      package along with the defaults.  This change makes it much
      easier to throw together bundles.
    o Moved system names definition from the .tek file into the
      installer code.  This means that several predefined systems
      are available, but that the user must add new system names
      to tekiInfo(systemNames) by hand in the code.  This should
      be changed so that there is a TekiRegisterSystemName function
      that registers a new name and checks for duplicates.
    o Broke wizard code into several functions, which makes the
      implementation much cleaner.

    o Added code to return errorCode and errorInfo (per Mark Diekhans)
    o Bug: New Tk window for each `wizard' screen is annoying, as they
      are each positioned in different places on the screen.
      Soln: Changed code to withdraw the wizard rather than destroying
      and recreating it each time.
    o Improved error handling inside TekiInstall so that it allows
      the user to continue istalling other packages even if one
      package installation fails.
    o Gave a title to the window that selects the "install directory" 
      (in TekiGetDirName)
