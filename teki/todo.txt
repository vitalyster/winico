Add routines to show file details (where installed, etc)
    This should go in the README window
Add routines to move an extension from one location to another
    (e.g., from a user-specific library to the main install location)
Add URL support for Web updates
    This fetches a TOC file from the package updateURL
The platform specific stuff is a bit messy -- need to figure
    out a new way to do it
Add splash screen, after installing a package, to ask user if they
    want to connect to the main Tcl archive and browse other packages
Work on terminal based user interface.
Work on the directory selection mechanism (i.e., in the wizard, when
    your selecting the target directory to install code in).  There
    are several problems:
       1. Can't select a directory through browsing
       2. Can't doesn't check if directory doesn't exist (causes
          error later in TekiInstall)
Only list install-archs for valid archs (e.g., install just example)
